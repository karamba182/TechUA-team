- OAuth2 integration for Google and Facebook login
- **Remaining Issue**: GoogleApiConfig initialization requires resolution
- **Target Deployment**: http://34.121.241.173:8080

## System Architecture

| Component | Status | IP Address | Technology Stack |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------------|
| Frontend App | Live | 34.132.63.67 | React + Nginx |
| Backend API | Config Phase | 34.121.241.173 | Spring Boot |
| Database | Operational | 34.173.19.35 | PostgreSQL 13 |
| Frontend LB | Ready | 34.36.132.33 | GCP Load Balancer |
| Backend LB | Standby | 34.54.161.166 | GCP Load Balancer |

## Technology Implementation

### Frontend Development
- React.js for modern, component-based UI development
- Ant Design for consistent and professional UI components
- Nginx as the production web server with optimized caching
- Responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility

### Backend Development  
- Spring Boot 3 for robust REST API development
- Spring Security for comprehensive authentication and authorization
- JPA/Hibernate for efficient database object-relational mapping
- PostgreSQL driver for database connectivity
- JWT for stateless authentication
- OAuth2 for third-party social login integration

### Infrastructure Setup
- Google Cloud Platform for enterprise-grade cloud hosting
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code practices
- Ansible for automated configuration management
- Ubuntu Linux as the base operating system for all services

## Deployment Procedures

### Infrastructure Provisioning
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Frontend Application Deployment
```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory_direct.yml deploy_frontend_only.yml
```

### Backend API Deployment
```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory_direct.yml deploy_backend_ultimate.yml
```

## Development Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Resolve GoogleApiConfig Issue**: Debug and fix Spring Boot startup configuration
2. **Complete Backend Deployment**: Achieve full API operational status
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Validate complete application functionality
4. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune application and database performance

### Future Enhancements
1. **SSL/TLS Implementation**: Deploy HTTPS certificates for secure connections
2. **Custom Domain Setup**: Configure branded domain names for production
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement automated testing and deployment workflows
4. **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Deploy comprehensive application and infrastructure monitoring
5. **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Project Achievements

### Technical Milestones
